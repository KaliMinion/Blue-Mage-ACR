## [ACR] Blue Mage <br/> <sub>*An open source combat routine for Blue Mage*</sub>
This is a Blue Mage combat routine that is flexible, easy to use, with highly customizable logic that any user can modify with ease. The goal is to assit the user in combat at any level, with optimal performance.

The challenges with creating a BLU ACR comes down to the number of abilities the job has, 80 spells and 4 role actions is no easy feat to weave together perfectly for every concievable combination of spells. So rather than creating an ACR in the traditional sense, I've created more of a hybrid skill manager system without any of the restrictions of a normal skill profile that has complete access to the Minion API.

#### Installation
If this is your first time downloading the profile, you'll want to download the [entire repo](https://github.com/KaliMinion/Blue-Mage-ACR/archive/master.zip "entire repo") and extract the zip in the directory shown below. <div align="center">![](https://i.imgur.com/QBm83ov.png)</div> If you're simply updating the main profile, then only download the [main lua file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KaliMinion/Blue-Mage-ACR/master/Kali's%20Blue%20Mage.lua "main lua file").
